    <dt>Respiration</dt>
    <dd>Every organism respires. Through respiration energy is created which is used by the cells to perform various functions. Respiration in mammals consist of two staes External, and Tissue respiration.</dd>

<dt>External respiration</dt>
<dd>External respiration, also known as breathing, is the exchange of gases between the environment and the organism. External respiration begins with inhalation of air. The inhaled air passes through these organs sequencially from the nostrils to the pharynx, laynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles than finally to the alveolar folds. At the aveolar gaseseous exchange takes place between the blood and air. This occurs in line with concentration gradient.</dd>
<dd>Blood and aveolar has a high concentration of carbondioxide and low concentration of oxygen. so oxygen from the inhaled air gets into the blood while carbon diooxide flows out.</dd>
<dt>Tissue Respiration</dt>
<dd>Tissue respiration is the energy extraction stage of respiration. it occurs in the cells. Oxygen in the blood is used to break down glucose and in the process ATP( Adenosine Triphosphate) an energy carrier is formed.</dd>
<dd>Tissue respiration consist of two processes 1. Glycolysis and 2. Kreb Cycle.</dd>
<dd>Glycolysis involves the sequencioal break down of glucose into 2 molecules of pyruvate in the cytoplasm. In the process 2 ATP are formed. In the presence of Oxygen, pyruvate is trasferred into mitochondria where it is further transformed to release 36 ATP</dd>{% endblock %}
